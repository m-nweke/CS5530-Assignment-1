The raw data was cleaned by using on hot encoding on the frailty column and saved to ../data_clean/cleaned_yield_data.csv.
From there, the correlation with the height and weight was checked against the measured grip strength.
It was determined that these columns had little to no correlation with the grip strength and as a result, they were dropped and the resulting table was saved to ../data_clean/cleaned_data.csv
